## Amnon Geifman

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute of Science under the supervision of [Prof. Ronen Basri](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/ronen/). My research focuses on deep learning theory, specifically I'm trying to understand highly over-parametrized neural networks.
Prior to that, I completed my Ms.c also under the supervision of Prof. Basri, where my thesis dealt with multi-view structure from motion and 3-D reconstruction.
